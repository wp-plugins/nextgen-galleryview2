<h2>Information regarding support notice:</h2>
<p>Two years ago, this plugin was in the WordPress repo, but was no longer being updated. I (@bhubbard) happens to work for a WordPress development company who had many clients using this plugin. At the time I took over supporting it, focusing primarily on improving performance and keeping it up with WordPress, not really adding any features. Since then a lot of changes have happened in the WordPress community. Since I started supporting this plugin, the WordPress builtin Gallery features have improved greatly, and NextGen-Gallery has gone thru some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/nextgen-gallery-2-0/">MAJOR CHANGES</a>. On top of that the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jackwanders/GalleryView">galleryview.js</a> script is no longer being actively developed on or supported by any developer.</p>

<p>This plugin has the largest number of users for any plugin I have ever worked on, and its been a great learning experience.If any developers are interested in taking over support I encourage you to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Galleryview/NextGEN-Galleryview/issues">open a issue on github</a> for the plugin with details on how you would want to improve it and continue support.  For users I encourage to look into alternative solutions, as there are MANY slider plugins available. I highly recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://soliloquywp.com">Soliloquy</a> as a WordPress Slider, however since most of you have your image in NextGen-Gallery already then I suggest getting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/nextgen-pro/">NextGen-Gallery Pro</a>. The NextGen-Gallery Pro offers a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nextgen-gallery.com/nextgen-pro/#profilmstrip">Filmstrip gallery</a> which will replicate what GalleryView was currently offering. </p>


<h3>Getting Started:</h3>
<p>Simply use galleryview as your NextGen-Gallery template within your shortcode.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NextGEN-Gallery</a> plugin is installed and activated.</li>
<li>Use the galleryview template within the ngg shortcode: <code>[nggallery id=1 template="galleryview"]</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Tip: While not required, this plugin default template is setup to support <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/photon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jetpack Photon</a> for improved performance. </p>

<br />
<h3>Advanced Instructions:</h3>
<p>For advanced users its recommended to create your own nextgen-gallery template. This will allow you to modify the template as needed. </p>

<ol>
<li>Create a folder called nggallery within your Wordpress theme.</li>
<li>Copy gallery-galleryview.php from the "view" folder of the plugin and place it within the nggallery folder you created.</li>
<li>Now modify the template to your desires and use with NextGenGallery. Reference: <a href="http://spaceforaname.com/galleryview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">List of Galleryview Options</a></li>
<li>Use the galleryview template within the ngg shortcode: <code>[nggallery id=1 template="galleryview"]</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: You can have multiple types of galleryviews. When creating the file within your theme, simply rename "galleryview" to something else such as "mygalleryview". You can do this as many times as you wish just be sure the names used are always unique, then simply use it within a shortcode: <code>[nggallery id=1 template="mygalleryview"]</code></p>
